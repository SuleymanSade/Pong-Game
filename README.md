This is a classis Pong game that is written in python pygame. This is a pretty simple code that can be used as a source for people who wants to learn pygame.
The code has pretty simple things: it has a ball in the middle, and 2 rectangles on the each side.
Also there is a counter for how many each side scored.
How to play:
1) This is a 2 player game which each of the players tryies to protect their side from the ball.
2) Right player uses arrows(up and down), left player uses w and s.
3) Ball bounces from up and down walls and from the rectangles.
4) Also ball speeds up when the game continues and when it is scored, it resets the speed.
5) YOu can see the score from the top blue colored text.
